This is the video module.  It handles all of the graphical rendering for the
program, excluding anything to do with the windowing environment, which is
handled in @c ::env.

Here are the definitions for some of the terms used in this module:

	Clip

		 An AABB which represents the clipping region, in the space of the
		 frame.  In the OpenGL implementation of the module, the clip is tied
		 to glScissor, affecting the scissor region.

	Frame

		 An AABB which represents a sub-region (or the full-region) of the
		 window (or the current render target), as a target for rendering.

		 You would use the frame, for example, if you only wanted to render
		 to a portion of the window, such as when letterboxing.

	Logical box

		An AABB which represents a sub-region (or the full-region) of the
		visible scene, in the space of the camera's field of view.  It is in
		the range of [0,1], with the origin at the XXX.

		The logical box is used, for example, if you only want to render the
		top-left quadrant of the scene, as seen from the camera.  In that
		case, you would use a logical box of XXX.

		One way to use the logical box is when rendering to a high-resolution
		off-screen buffer using the window as a medium for rendering.  See
		"Rendering Print Resolution Screenshots" by Alex Vlachos and Evan
		Hart, Game Programming Gems 2.
