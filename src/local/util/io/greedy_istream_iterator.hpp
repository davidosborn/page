		 * This class has the following behaviour:
		 * - You may specify a terminator, which will transform the iterator
		 *   into an end-of-stream iterator when it is encountered.
		 * - This class will read everything until the next delimiter or the
		 *   end-of-stream, and then attempt to deserialize the value from what
		 *   was read.
		 * - When no characters are available before the next delimiter, the
		 *   value is default initialized.
