	 * A configuration variable with a parameterized type.
	 *
	 * This class provides the interface for user access to configuration
	 * variables.  Each instance represents a configuration variable.
	 * Dereferencing yields the variable's value, and assignment sets the value.
	 *
	 * This class can be configured on construction with a number of filters.
	 * These filters affect the way the variable's value is interpreted when
	 * it is read from, or written to, the source, or when getting or setting
	 * it.
	 *
	 * @tparam T The @em real type of the variable's value, so far as the user
	 *         of the variable is concerned.
	 *
	 * @tparam ExternT The external type of the variable's value.  This is the
	 *         variable's type when stored in a @c Source, such as a file.  For
	 *         @c enum values, it is often @c std::string.
