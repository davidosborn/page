The Pilgrim's Progress
----------------------

Evangelist -> Christian
Christian is convicted, family won't accept
Christian loves Christ more than family, leaves family
Family realizes he was right later and comes after him
Everyone else tries to tell them they are wrong


Courtesy of John

Repentence = the cross -> healing and deliverance


Poem from the Bible
-------------------

All men are like grass,
and all their glory is like the flowers of the field.
The grass withers,
and the flowers fall,
but the word of our God stands forever.
