* Fixed a missing function-call argument causing vid::opengl::ShaderOutlineResources to throw.

2011-08-12  David Osborn  <davidcosborn@gmail.com>

* Fixed a problem where the scene was getting clipped to the initial size of the window.

2011-08-10  David Osborn  <davidcosborn@gmail.com>

* Fixed a problem where glGetActiveUniform was including the array dimensions in the uniform name, but we were not matching for that in Program::FindUniform.  So now we remove the array dimensions from our copy of uniform name.

* Added some more libraries (mostly audio-related) to install-depends.sh.

2011-08-06  David Osborn  <davidcosborn@gmail.com>

* Changed some conditional operator expressions (in src/res/load) to have a more explicit type, in response to an instance of "return x ? function-pointer : 0" producing bad values (maybe related to GCC bug #43932).
* Made it so that aud::Driver::Play attempts to load the sound immediately and throws if it can't (previously it was deferring until aud::Driver::Update).
* Made it so that game::Scene issues a warning and keeps going if the music fails to play.
